# Portalvis
Portal Visualizer

## Overview
The goal of making this tool was to aleviate the tedium of gathering information about portals for high level decision making in the game of screeps. Instead of manually panning around the game map and examining portals one at a time, this tool enables you to see all portal data at once and get more detailed information if desired.

Another goal of making this tool was to learn more about web development and some of the moving parts that make it up. A lot of the parts of this project are things that I had never done before so do not expect everything to be done in the best way possible.

It uses a [node](https://nodejs.org) server to handle the serving of files as well as the updating of the data and uses a javascript visualization library called [D3](https://d3js.org/) to handle the visualizations.
